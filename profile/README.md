J.K. Incorporated is a British software company that was founded in 1983 by Kian Gentry and Jacob Fargi. 
The company specialized in creating software to make home computing easier, and its first product was JK-DOS, a competing product to Microsoft's MS-DOS.

JK-DOS was released in 1983 and quickly gained popularity among home computer users due to its user-friendly interface and extensive documentation and support materials.
However, the product faced stiff competition from MS-DOS and was discontinued in 1986.

Despite the discontinuation of JK-DOS, the company continued to thrive and focused on developing new software products. 
In the years following the discontinuation of JK-DOS, J.K. Incorporated released a number of successful products for a variety of operating systems, including Windows and Linux.

The company's current flagship product is EYN-DOS, a suite of utilities and applications that provides a wide range of functions for home computer users.
According to the product's documentation on GitHub (https://github.com/JK-Incorporated/EYN-DOS/blob/Main/README.md), EYN-DOS includes a number of features designed to make home computing easier, such as a file manager, a text editor, support for various file formats, entertaining games, and much more.

Jacob Fargi left the company in 2019, leaving Kian Gentry as the sole owner of J.K. Incorporated.
Despite this change, the company has continued to thrive and remains a well-respected software company known for its commitment to creating user-friendly products that make home computing easier and more accessible.
